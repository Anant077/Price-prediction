# üè∑Ô∏è Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict prices based on various input features using Python. It demonstrates the end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## üìå Project Objective

To develop a regression model that accurately predicts the **price of a product/service/property** based on provided features. This type of model can be useful in domains like real estate, e-commerce, or used car pricing.

## üß† Technologies & Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Model building & evaluation)
- XGBoost / RandomForest (Optional advanced models)
